# Part 1 What is Stoicism?

> "If it is not right, do not do it, if it is not true, do not say it." —Marcus Aurelius

## Ch 1 The Promise of Stoic Philosophy

### Practice the Art of Living: Become a Warrior-Philosopher

> "First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do" —Epictetus

This practical "art of living" dimension of Stoicism holds two main promises: 
1. it teaches you how to live a happy and smoothly flowing life
2. it teaches you how to stay emotionally resilient to retain that happy and smoothly flowing life even in the face of adversity

### Promise #1: Eudaimonia

### Promise #2: Emotinoal Resilience

主动接受磨练 -> 以应对突发困难

**a calm mind set**
The Stoics identified strong emotions as our ultimate weakness; especially when we let them dictate our behavior. They’re toxic to eudaimonia and they’re at the root of all human suffering. Unfortunately, according to the Stoics, most of us are enslaved to passions—strong negative emotions such as irrational fear, grief, or anger. This is why so many of us are miserable, we’re far away from being a tower of strength, we’re far away from being at good terms with our ideal self. Our passions cause us to act far beneath of what we’re capable of.

If we want to be able to act like our ideal self, say the Stoics, we need to keep our emotions in check, we need to tame them so they won’t get in the way of the good life. “No, thank you, I can’t afford to panic right now.”
